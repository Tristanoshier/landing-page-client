        "title": "Why I’m Starting a Blog",
        "body": "I’ve always wanted to create my own unique platform to share my journey as a young software engineer figuring out where I belong in this incredibly immense field. I’ve been close to starting a YouTube channel in the past to share my thoughts and advice but being camera shy has always stood in the way; therefore, I think a blog is a great place to start.  <br><br> I started my programming journey a little over a year ago at the time that this post was written and have been writing code and learning new concepts ever since. Being in this field is very intimidating at first due to the breadth of domains there are to choose from plus the time commitment it takes to get into some of them. I think by sharing my advice and personal experience of taking on some of these challenges, I can really help guide or at least ease some nerves for young programmers who are just getting started. <br><br> I’m definitely not an expert in this field by any means and still have a lot to learn just like anyone else in the rapidly changing field of technology, but I do believe it helps to have opinions from all levels of experience. <br><br> Whether you’re in your first two years of experience, just started learning how to code, or even just starting thinking about wanting to learn, I think there’s a lot of value in not doing this alone. Hearing about and learning from other people’s experiences will only make this journey easier for you and give you a sense of direction. <br><br> That being said, this is the first week and introductory post for this blog so next week I will start diving into some of my personal experiences and challenges I have faced as a software engineer.  <br><br> Until then, remember to keep learning, take care of yourself, and have fun. :)",

        "title": "A flame my love, a frequency - Colleen",
        "body": "This album has become one of my favorite albums to listen to throughout the past couple of years and is the main reason why I chose it as my first album to write about. I typically don’t like listening to music with lyrics while coding or writing since I find them distracting but this album happens to be one of the exceptions considering the lyrics are limited and don’t disrupt my train of thought. <br><br> Not only does this album mean a lot to me, but it has such a beautiful atmospheric sound to it that brings you to a peaceful state of mind while listening. This peaceful state of mind makes productivity a lot less stressful so I can’t tell you the amount of times I’ve listened to this album while working on something.  <br><br> Getting work done to this album is very enjoyable, but I also recommend listening to take some time away from work and life’s responsibilities to relax and enjoy the moment. It’s great to listen to while taking a walk, stargazing, or while enjoying some nightly reading before bed.  <br><br> The album is fully electronic which is unusual for Colleen’s previous albums if you decide to dive deeper into her work. I personally really enjoy electronic music and spend a lot of time listening to artists such as Boards of Canada, John Hopkins, etc… so this album happens to be my personal favorite of hers. Despite the dark themes in this album touching on death and some of the experiences in Colleen’s life, the soft vocals and light melodies create a very antithetical sound. <br><br> For me, listening to the dolorous chords and blissful synths scattered throughout this album bring memories of driving through Big Sur and Monterey Bay watching the waves crash up against the cliff sides. A beautiful memory with an even more beautiful album to accompany it which I will never forget.",

        "title": "Should You Go to College for Computer Science?",
        "body": "I could have named this blog title “Should You Go to College?” but I thought it would be fun to talk about this question for a broader audience of people in a future post and focus on what I know best for this post. I think this question is becoming much more relevant these days with the rising cost of attending a university and the rapid growth of free available education on the internet. 20 to 30 years ago this question would be an easy one to answer but these days the arguments for going to college are becoming slimmer and more focused on the experience you have rather than the education you receive. While some career paths such as the medical field, law, etc… are impossible to go into without a four year degree and most times even more schooling, many other fields are struggling to find reasons why they should require applicants to have attended university. <br><br> Before I give my opinion on the question itself, a little background about me will help give you some perspective of what I've experienced and plays into my opinion quite heavily. After high school, I decided to go to a four year university to study Computer Science in hopes to find a successful career. I had always been a little curious about learning to code and what you could do with it after learning HTML, CSS, and a little Java in a couple of poorly taught classes in high school. While I was in college, I took discrete mathematics, calculus, computer architecture, advanced programming in Java, and an intro to programming class taught in Python. At the same time, I was spending lots of money to take classes such as geology, communication, and even a walking class for my required health credit. I started feeling pretty stuck around the beginning of my third semester when I had made the dean's list multiple times and still didn't really understand what I was doing. I wanted to spend my full day learning how to code and understanding the ins and outs of software engineering but also had to find the time to balance the workload of other college classes and that became very frustrating. <br><br> I started to search for other options thinking there must be a better way for me to learn how to do this. While searching the internet and talking to a few software engineers in the field I came to the realization that there were two other main directions I could go in to learn how to code.  <br><br> 1. I could go to a coding bootcamp.<br> 2. I could teach myself on the internet. <br><br> I was drawn to the coding bootcamp route since the one that I found was teaching full stack development and the transition from college to a training program would be a lot easier than going from traditional school to navigating my way through the internet. I knew my parents would be a little happier about this option as well.  <br><br> So, I finished up my third semester at university and dropped out to attend a coding bootcamp a little over a month later. The program was three months long, Monday through Friday, nine to five. This was a much faster pace than I was used to at university but I was excited because I was getting to spend all of my time learning how to code, building full stack web applications, and getting the experience of working on projects with others. It was an amazing program and for the first time in my life, I looked forward to getting up early to go learn something.  <br><br> Unfortunately, I graduated from this bootcamp in April of 2020. COVID-19 caused many companies to go on a hiring freeze and started to change the way we as humans go about our daily lives and communicate with each other. After adapting to the remote lifestyle, I continued to code everyday from nine to five and sometimes even later in hopes to finally land an offer as a software engineer. Experience was the only thing holding me back at this point and I was looking for any opportunity I could find to keep learning and keep growing in this field. Luckily, three months later, I was able to land a job as a software engineer at a consulting company located in Indianapolis.  <br><br> The point of me telling you this story is to explain that there are many ways of getting from point A to point B, and this is just how I personally managed to make it happen. Going back to the main question of this post, I think it depends on your situation if you should go to college or not. Specifically for Computer Science, I think you should only go to college if you have the money to do it without coming out of school with a lot of debt. I think there are a plethora of different ways to learn how to code and learn software engineering and going to college happens to be the most expensive and sometimes the most time consuming option. If you have the money, I would recommend spending it on a coding bootcamp and then going the self taught route until you are able to land your first job. If you don't have a dollar to your name or a computer to write code on, I would recommend picking up a serving job at a local restaurant and saving up for a computer and some internet access. I would then just teach yourself online through YouTube, Udemy, and gain some LinkedIn Learning certificates. It might take you longer to get a job in the field but if you are dedicated and patient I believe something will come along eventually.  <br><br> I think one thing a lot of people forget to mention when they talk about how they landed their job is how important luck played a role in that scenario. Sometimes all it takes for you to land a job is the right mixture of preparation, drive, and luck. For example, I was able to land an interview at the company I currently work for because someone from my cohort at the bootcamp I went to reached out and asked for my resume since her company was hiring software engineers. <br><br> Luck doesn't have to be rare though, you can increase your luck by making friends in the field, applying to as many companies as possible, and going to networking events (even virtual ones!). I think with enough repetition of these actions while continuing to work on your skills will eventually get you from point A to point B. I didn't have a degree or any work experience in the field when I was hired as a software engineer. All I did was make lots of friends, apply to as many companies as I could, and tried to go to at least one networking event a week and I was able to make this life changing event happen in roughly six months and so can you. <br><br> Remember to stay positive, help out others around you, and enjoy the journey! <br><br>   “The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I'll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you're continually putting happiness off until the next milestone.” <strong>― James Clear</strong>",

        "title": "Experiencing Burnout",
        "body": "It's extremely exciting learning something new that you are passionate about and I think at some points even more exciting planning out how you are going to learn that thing. During this process of planning, we are almost always fixated on the end goal and brush over all the work that will actually take place to get there. This can be very easy to do along with ignoring the thought that we will ever experience burnout during this learning journey. Unfortunately at some point or another, most of us will experience this feeling of burnout, especially the longer the time frame that you plan to spend studying. <br><br> About five months ago I started one of these learning journeys to improve my understanding of Computer Science and simultaneously improve my software engineering skills. I was inspired after reading Scott Young's <i>Ultralearning</i> where he gives advice on how to learn efficiently and also goes into his year long study plan that he called “The MIT Challenge '' where he finished the entire MIT Computer Science undergrad degree in a year. This inspired me to fill in some of the gaps of understanding that I missed from leaving university three semesters into my CS degree and also I was ready to take on something a little more challenging than I was used to. This process consisted of watching MIT's CS lectures on YouTube, reading various CS and math textbooks, and practicing algorithms and data structure problems daily. I did this almost every day for 12 to 14 hours which included me working as a software engineer as well as a teaching assistant at the coding bootcamp that I graduated from. It was a tough schedule and I honestly thought when I started that I would never experience burnout and I would be able to keep up the schedule for at least eight months.  <br><br> Well about four months into this journey I experienced burnout harder than I ever had before. This study plan became very much obsessive to the point where I wasn't eating or sleeping as much as I should have been and did not focus my time on anything other than CS and mathematics. I would go to bed watching lectures and coding interviews and wake up and do the same while I was getting ready for work. I simply overworked myself and I have learned a lot from it which is why I decided to write this post. <br><br> I took about a month-long break once I started losing all of my motivation and took some time to read over other subjects, go on a few vacations, focus on eating a healthy amount, and getting my sleep schedule back to normal. This is the first thing I would recommend if you are starting to really burnout and have lost all motivation. Take a step back and look at your daily habits to see if you are taking care of yourself and putting yourself in the right environment for learning. This is so important and it can actually be counterproductive to your learning if you are not getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and overall taking care of yourself. Another thing you can do is look at your timeline for your goal and daily schedule and ask yourself if it is a realistic amount of time to achieve that goal. It may not be, and you might need to take a little more time to accomplish that goal if you truly want to learn something or be great at something. I realized that I probably needed more than eight months to learn what I was wanting to learn and I had to recognize that it was okay to take that extra time. Parkinson's Law is great unless it starts affecting your overall well being and mental health. One last tip that I would recommend for people who are working full time while trying to study is separating your work in time slots. When you're at work try to focus only on what you're doing there and not your studying. Same goes for when you are studying, you should only be focusing on that and not your day job. Trying to multitask these two things will only make your life more stressful and cause disruption to your learning. <br><br> Since realizing that my approach to learning was becoming unhealthy and taking the advice above to fix those issues, I started back up my study plan about two weeks ago with a better plan that has allowed me to study and also enjoy other parts of life. I recommend taking a break for anyone who is experiencing burnout whether that is a couple of days, weeks, or even a month like I did. It will do wonders for your overall well being and I think it makes diving back into the subject exciting again just like when you started. It's also important to know that experiencing burnout is a completely normal feeling and will happen to most of us at some point so don't feel like you have failed when you experience this. You might just need a break in order to keep going.  <br><br> Remember to take care of yourself and enjoy the journey as much as the thought of achieving the goal.",

        "title": "Moving from Indiana to NYC",
        "body": "So I've lived in Indiana my whole life and have had plenty of exposure to the endless cornfields, suburban style living, and pretty harsh summers and winters. I think Indiana is great at giving families a safe, affordable, and simple life which is a pretty common and reasonable thing to desire as a new family or a retired couple. That being said, as a 21 year old looking to grow and experience the world, Indiana creates a yawning gulf between aspiration and reality. Career opportunities are not phenomenal here and I often had a hard time finding things to do in my free time. With so many chain businesses and so little drive for creativity around me, it really drained my excitement for everyday life. <br><br> I first went to NYC in 2015 to visit my uncle who was generous enough to show me around the city and provide me with so many experiences that the city has to offer. Being in Manhattan completely changed my perception of the world by seeing so many people from different backgrounds and cultures come together to create such an incredible place. I loved it. I loved looking around and seeing tiny glimpses of peoples' days which I had never thought of before. There was a store for everything, a restaurant for every genre and subgenre of food, and the opportunity to do any activity you wanted. I looked around and saw everyone being the person they wanted to be without any judgment. It was something that I had never really experienced before and made me realize that I had to get out of Indiana someday because I was missing out on so much that life had to offer.  <br><br> On July 10th, 2021 I left my home in Westfield, IN and moved to Manhattan with a suitcase full of clothes and my laptop and it has been the best decision that I have ever made. At the time of writing this post, I've been in the city for about a month now and it feels like I've been here for an entire year (in a good way) with all the experiences I have had so far. I've met so many amazing people, have had some of the best food i've ever tried, and have been presented with incredible career opportunities left and right. Living here is everything I ever thought it would be and more. <br><br> If you ever feel unsatisfied with where you're living and feel like it would be too challenging to go through the process of moving elsewhere, I promise you it's worth it. It's more than worth the time and effort to leave what you're used to and to go experience something completely new and exciting. It feels great to wake up every morning knowing that each day will be filled with an array of new experiences and various new ways to grow. I can not emphasize enough how important it is to save the money to travel and break out of the bubble you are used to because it can lead to a much better life that you never knew existed. <br><br> Looking back on the first time I visited the city, I now feel like so many of the people that I saw walking around being themselves with no judgment whatsoever and it feels incredible.  <br><br> Thank you, New York City.",

        "title": "2001: A Space Odyssey",
        "body": "Stanley Kubrick is one of my favorite directors of all time since many of his movies have inspired me in various ways that I have only experienced from watching his films. One movie in particular that has always left me with a strong desire to create is Kubrick’s <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, released in 1968. I can always rely on his movies to entertain me, but this movie in particular brings a whole other level of experience that I haven’t seen before in any other film. <br><br> I’m going to list a couple of my favorite things that make this movie so special in my opinion so if you haven’t watched it already, I think it’s definitely worth 149 minutes of your life doing so. <br><br><ul><li>The experience of this movie strongly comes from the fact that it prioritizes symbolism and thematic development over traditional storytelling and is split up into four sections giving it great overall structure to communicate the very complex themes brought up throughout the movie.</li><br><li>The way the soundtrack is used to drive the movie through the different scenes and create a plethora of different emotions throughout is quite special especially for the time that it was released. You only need to watch the first couple of minutes of the film to realize how powerful the soundtrack really is.</li><br><li> The smooth and extremely creative transitions throughout the movie really make the editing stand out from anything I have ever seen. My favorite example is when the prehistoric bone from the first act is thrown into the air and transitions into a spaceship through space which starts the second act. This transition skips 4 million years yet is so elegant and perfectly executed. </li><br><li>Lastly, being someone who enjoys learning about Artificial Intelligence, it’s very interesting yet terrifying to see HAL navigate his way around humans in a similar fashion to Max Tegmark’s Prometheus example in <i>Life 3.0</i>. It always surprises me to see these themes and ideas were brought up and executed so well in a film released in 1968. </li></ul> <br> These are just a few of the things that make this one of my favorite movies of all time. This will always be my go to movie when I need a creative boost in my work.",
